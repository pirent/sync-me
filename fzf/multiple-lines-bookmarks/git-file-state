Git file state

-----------------------
Each file in working directory is tracked or untracked
Tracked files are files in the last snapshot, either: unmodified, modified, and staged
Untracked files are files Git doesn't know about
First time clone project > tracked + unmodified
Edit file > tracked + modified
Stage file > tracked + staged
