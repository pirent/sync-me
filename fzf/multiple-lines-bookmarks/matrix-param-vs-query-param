When to use query parameters versus matrix parameters?
-----------------------
Query parameters: http://example.com/apples?order=random&color=blue
Matrix parameters: http://example.com/apples;order=random;color=blue

The main differences are:
* urls with query params won't have their response cached by intermediaries/proxies (at present)
* matrix parameters may appear anywhere in path
* calculating the relative uri is different
* query params are generally abused to add new verbs instead of using existing methods on resources
* matrix parameters are not resources, they are aspects that help reference a resource in an information space that is difficult to represent within a hierarchy
