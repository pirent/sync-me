# Web application autonomy
----------------------------------
Web Applications can be bundled into a single Web Archive (WAR file) or as a directory tree.

- /WEB-INF/
    Special Servlet API defined directory used to store anything related to the Web Application that are not part of the public access of the Web Application. If there is content that is accessed by a Web Application internally, but that should also never be accessed directly by a web browser, this is the directory it would placed in
- /WEB-INF/web.xml
	Required deployment descriptor defining various behavior of the Web Application.
- /WEB-INF/classes/
	Location for Web Application specific compiled java classes
- /WEB-INF/lib/
	Directory for JAR files (libraries)

The Jetty internal WebAppClassloader will load classes from /WEB-INF/classes/ first, then from jar files found in /WEB-INF/lib/.
