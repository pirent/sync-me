Type of session and which file to load
---------------
A login shell is a shell session that begins by authenticating the user
  >> when you are signing into a terminal session or through SSH and authenticate

A non-login shell is when a new shell session started from within your authenticated session
  >> call "bash"

An interactive shell session is a shell session that is attached to a terminal

A non-interactive shell session is one is not attached to a terminal session
  >>  A script run from the command line is usually run in a non-interactive, non-login shell

A session started as a login session will read configuration details from the /etc/profile file first.
It will then look for the first login shell configuration file in the user's home directory to get user-specific configuration details.
  ~/.bash_profile
  ~/.bash_login
  ~/.profile

A non-login shell will read /etc/bash.bashrc and then the user-specific ~/.bashrc file to build its environment.
