Environmental variable VERSUS shell variable
-------------------------
Every time a shell session spawns, a process takes place to gather and compile information that should be available to the shell process and its child processes.

Basically the environment provides a medium through which the shell process can get or set settings and, in turn, pass these on to its child processes.

The environment is implemented as strings that represent key-value pairs.

Environmental variables 
  are variables that are defined for the current shell and are inherited by any child shells or processes. 
  are used to pass information into processes that are spawned from the shell.

Shell variables 
  are variables that are contained exclusively within the shell in which they were set or defined. 
  are often used to keep track of ephemeral data, like the current working directory.
