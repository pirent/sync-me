--- Truncate table versus Delete From ---

Truncate is more efficient because it's a bulk operation, and does not reference any row before deleting; 
while DELETE * FROM, actually, works on one row at a time.

But if your table has constraint (e.g., foreign key), then you cannot truncate that table.
Workaround:
1) Switch to DELETE FROM
	DELETE FROM mytest.instance;
	ALTER TABLE mytest.instance AUTO_INCREMENT = 1;
2) it might break data integrity 
	SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 0; 
	TRUNCATE table $table_name; 
	SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS = 1;
